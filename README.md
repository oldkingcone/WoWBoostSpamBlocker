# WoWBoostSpamBlocker
i hate boosting sellers, and this addon filters every single channel including whispers for advertisements, and blocks the user from messaging you. It removes ALL boost advertisement spams from showing up in your chat at all, its beautiful. 

When a user is blocked, a single message is shown about Who, What, and Where the user was blocked from. 

you can access the addon by typing /cf or /chatfilter
