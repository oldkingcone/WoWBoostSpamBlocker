# WoWBoostSpamBlocker
i hate boosting sellers, and this addon filters every single channel including whispers for advertisements, and blocks the user from messaging you. It removes ALL boost advertisement spams from showing up in your chat at all, its beautiful. 

When a user is blocked, a single message is shown about Who, What, and Where the user was blocked from. 

you can access the addon by typing /cf or /chatfilter


Because i am not a lua programmer, i am very open to any and all suggestions to make this better. If you find an issue, open an issue, if you have an enhancement, please open a pull request, fuck boosting, fuck boosting spammers.


just take the ChatFilter folder and place it into your addons folder, itll work right out of the box.


-- USE WITH CAUTION

this is still a buggy mess right now.
